# Forms-and-Form-Validation


This repository contains a React application that implements a form with validation for required fields without using third-party libraries. The form includes the following fields:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Username
- E-mail
- Password (with show/hide functionality)
- Phone No. (country code and number)
- Country (dropdown)
- City (dropdown)
- Pan No.
- Aadhar No.

The application validates these fields, displays error messages, disables form submission until all fields are filled correctly, and shows all filled details on a new route upon successful submission.
